# meme maker with docker

üçÉ Project created follow the steps of [Erick Wendel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOpwfg1GJig)

I'm made this to test how docker works with node.js, live reload and volumes

extra tips:
    sometimes, for some unknow reason, nodemon doesn't work correctly 
    so, u'll need to add a `-L` or `--legacy-watch` flag in ur nodemon script.
    this is a workaround recomended on [nodemon documentation](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#application-isnt-restarting)
