# meme maker with docker

üçÉ Project created following the steps of [Erick Wendel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOpwfg1GJig).

I created it to test how Docker works with Node.js, Live Reload and Volumes.


**Extra Tip:**

Sometimes, for some unknown reason, nodemon does not work properly.

Therefore you need to add a `-L` or `--legacy-watch` flag in your nodemon script.

This is a workaround recommended in the [nodemon documentation](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#application-isnt-restarting).
